# Takuzu Solver

A python class to solve [Takuzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuzu) puzzles using Artificial Inteligence search algorithms.

## Overview

The class was implemented in `takuzu.py` to make use of the search algorithms included in `search.py`. 

A set of start boards and their solutions is also included in `testes-takuzu/`. To test one of the boards, it must be given as input to `takuzu.py`. A comparison of multiple search algorithms can also be executed by runing `comparer.py` with a board as input.
